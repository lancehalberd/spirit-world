Artificial Cloud Cover + Mist around Vanara Village that gently suppresses their spirit energy.



Helix/World Tree
- Looks like white coral that grows in spiraling tubes that occassionally branch out from the main stalk.
- Smaller quick growing mushrooms+tendrils grow out of the coral in various places.
- The coral can grow to shape and forms rooms and corridors as desired.
- The main trunk is often constructed into a gauntlet of trials to test Vanara who want to crew ships to other planets.
- The tree can pull out of the material world to hide itself, similar to Vanara invisibility.

They are made of a pale hard material like bone or shell and grow towards the light like trees with branches and canopies. Imagine a coral reef that has evolved into a single organism.

The mature trees grow large enough to extend beyond the planet's atmosphere, like organic space elevators. They produce pods in low gravity that they then disperse across space in the Spirit World to populate other planets and solar systems.
The trees themselves house the mind of the Vanara Tree Spirits and the capacity of the spirit increases with the size and number of the spirit trees.

In the game I want to depict three versions of the tree:
Smaller versions that are about the size of other trees in the game, a little bigger than 64x64 in the game's resolution. These are special "daughter" trees that the Vanara have created in order to expand the power of the Tree Spirit without completely taking over the planet's ecology.

A medium size version which would probably be rendered as a single large object on the overworld similar to how the Staff Tower is drawn. This would probably be ~128px wide "trunk" that extends up into the sky and represents a half grown Spirit Tree that stopped in the middle of its growth to prevent damaging the planet.

Then there would be a large version which will probably require its own exterior tile set to render the outside of in game and it will probably be  between 196-256px wide trunk but also have special lower resolution artwork to display it from far away on the map or in cutscenes. This one is large and extends out of the atmosphere so mostly the player will just see small parts of it at once.

Vanara Philosophy
Vanara's hybrid biology makes them incredibly resilient and powerful. If they wanted they could use this power to subjugate most races they encounter. However the Vanara Tree god's evolved from a terrible crucible of constant war and competition that they were only able to escape through a commitment to cooperation and harmony which is the foundation of their


Waterfall Tower
The waterfall tower is a Spirit Dungeon accessed through a spirit portal behind a waterfall in the mountains.
The surface of water in the material world produces a fast growing but often brittle crystal material in the spirit world.
Because the waterfall tower occupies the same space as the waterfall, these crystals are constantly growing everywhere in the tower and create a constant caustic atmosphere for beings in the spirit world. This causes the MC to constantly lose their Spirit Energy as their subtle body uses up the energy to protect them from the effects of the crystals.

Usually the crystals grow and shatter and then disintegrate, but sometimes they form stable formations, in particle spherical beads of different sizes are stable and can be a useful material in the Spirit World, which does not have access to many materials with useful properties.

The tower was built around the waterfall as a processing facility for accruing these beads that naturally form from the waterfall, and many of the enemies found in the tower are there to help with the processing or to guard the facility from thieves or sabotage.
The things that look like waterfalls inside the dungeon are actually large flows of crystal beads that are being processed through the facility and may eventually be shipped from the tower to other parts of the spirit world. There are piles of crystal beads covering the ground in many places that obscure the ground underneath them and cause the MC to slip on them when not equipped with the Iron Boots or Cloudwalking Boots.

A lot of the specific elements of the story are not nailed down, but in the current iteration, the tower is overseen by a being called the River Dragon which used to be the Fertility God worshiped in the Fertility Temple on the river. This temple was destroyed when the Vanara ship crashed and the crater from the crash became a lake as the river filled it. The River Dragon,having an affinity for water in the Spirit World, took over the management of the Waterfall tower(the atmosphere of the tower is damaging to many spirit beings) after the River Temple was destroyed and a new Fertility Temple was constructed in the woods of the Vanara settlement.

Among other things, the materials from the Waterfall Tower are being used to construct a new Sky Palace in the Spirit World that the River Dragon plans to move into.


From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_King
"After several failed attempts at execution, Sun Wukong is locked into Laozi's eight-way trigram crucible for 49 days in order to be distilled into an elixir by samadhi fires; this will allow Laozi to regain his pills of longevity. The fire of the crucible is hot enough to burn beings of so much unspeakable power, they rival Buddha himself.

However, when the cauldron is opened 49 days later, the Monkey King jumps out, having survived by hiding in a corner marked by the wind trigram, where there was less fire. In fact, the heat from the samadhi fires have reinforced his bodily frame, making him stronger than ever before and impervious to greater damage. The heat also gives him a new ability; the Monkey King can now recognize evil with his new huǒyǎn-jīnjīng (火眼金睛, lit. 'fiery eyes and golden pupils'). Sun Wukong then proceeds to destroy the crucible and makes his way to Heaven's main chamber to confront the Jade Emperor and his senior advisors."

These eight trigrams are:
    Heaven, Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Thunder, Mountain and Lake.

Order is:
    Earth - Navigate obstacles and rocks
    Mountain - Climb
    Water - Timed Bead flows (50 Jade check)
    Wind - Pits
    Thunder - Lightning barriers
    Fire - Fire turrets (Silver Ore check)
    Lake - Lava pools
    Heaven - NPC with "Iron Skin" reward

Dungeon flavor philosophy:
    All Vanara structures are part of the Vanara ship and related to some functionality, such as the regeneration pods.
    All Native structures are built to native spirit gods who functioned as servants to the old native spirit beings and were created for specific purposes like resource harvesting, processing and crafting.

Dungeon 1: Vanara Tomb (fortress around the Cocoon)
    - Traps+locks to keep intruders away. Need to use bow to enter
        - Someone was stealing Vanara remains
    - Built around a suspended animation capsule
        - The Vanara population is too large so they rotate members in and out of suspended animation.
        - Suspension pods erase Vanara memories to prevent then from becoming restless.
        - Pods also regenerate Vanara bodies, which would break down without nurishment from the spirit world.
        - Vanara village population is 20-30 individuals at a time. There are 100-300 total, most suspended.
    - The goal of the dungeon is to meet with the care taker who looks after and maintains the suspended Vanara.
        - The original Vanara crew rotate members into the care taker role once every X years.
    - A facade is built aroaund the structure to disguise it as a mundane structure
        - The Vanara village posts guards in addition to the traps to keep people out
    - MCs father refused to go back to sleep, having fallen in love with MCs mother and not wanting to forget about her.

Jade Palace:
    - Boss Reward: Phoenix Feather
        Uses a feather from a legender spirit beast that could survive on its own in the material world and once threatened to destroy the world.
        The War God wants to combine science and Vanara biology to make a new "Void Phoenix" to replicate the old beast.
        An ancestor of the MC+Hero defeated the original Phoenix
        The feather is kept in the Jade palace, too dangerous to use but too precious to destroy

River Temple:
    - No NPCs here, this was the old Fertility Temple, but it was destroyed by the Vanara Ship crashing. The survivors all moved to the new Fertility Temple near the forest (Forest Temple).
